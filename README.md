# cc64

cc64 is a [small-C](C-lang-subset.md) compiler,
written in [Forth](Why-Forth.md), targeting the 6502 CPU and hosted on the C64.
I wrote it during my university years;
the majority of the code was written 1989-1991.

Motivated by buzzphp who's building a
[C library for cc64](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cc64/),
and also by Johan Kotlinski of
[DurexForth](https://github.com/jkotlinski/durexforth) and
[AcmeForth](https://github.com/jkotlinski/acmeforth),
I am now finally open-sourcing the project.

The current version to use is v0.5; see [Versions](Versions.md) for details.

See [Usage](Usage.md) for how to use cc64; see also
[Emulator and file formats](File-formats.md) on the emulator setup I arrived at.
It also explains which files to grab for running cc64 on a real C64.

I hope you'll find cc64 fun to use; I definitely had - and am having -
fun developing it.
