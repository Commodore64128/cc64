# cc64

cc64 is a small-C compiler written in Forth, targeting the 6502 CPU and
hosted on the C64. I wrote it during my university years; the
majority of the code was written 1989-1991.

Motivated by puzzphp's project to build a
[C library for cc64](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cc64/) and by
Johan Kotlinski of [DurexForth](https://github.com/jkotlinski/durexforth),
I am now finally open-sourcing the project.
