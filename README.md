# cc64
cc64 is a small-C compiler written in ultraForth, hosted on the C64, and
targeting the 6502 CPU. I wrote it during my university days; the
majority of the code was written 1989-1991.

v03 and v04 were the first two versions I published as uploads to
a public ftp server (ftp.funet.fi to /pub/cbm/c64/programming IIRC),
on 6-Oct-1994 and 3-Nov-1995, respectively (thanks go to Craig Bruce
for keeping the archive on http://csbruce.com/cbm/ftp/c64/programming/).

Motivated by puzzphp's project to build a C library for cc64
(https://sourceforge.net/projects/cc64/) and by Johan Kotlinski of
DurexForth (https://github.com/jkotlinski/durexforth), I am now finally
open-sourcing the project.
