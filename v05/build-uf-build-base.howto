This file describes how the basis for building cc64, the slightly
enhances ultraForth system uf-build-base is built from the plain
vanilla uF83-382-c64 ultraForth core.

In the cc64/v05 directory, run
 build-uf-build-base.sh

Type
  load "uF83-382-c64",8
  run

This should result in a prompt
  ultraFORTH-83 3.82-C64

Type
  1 drive 1 load

This will adapt the memory configuration for maximum Forth code memory
size, and will reset the Forth system after it's done.

Type
  1 drive 130 load 132 load

This will load savesystem and the include word set.
At the end you should get a message

Â£ exists ok

Type
  savesystem uf-build-base

Exit Vice and, in the same cc64/v05 directory, type
  make

This will re-generate uf-build-base.P00 and uf-build-base.T64.
