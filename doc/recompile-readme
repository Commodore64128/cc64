To recompile cc64 from sources without using the main Makefile,
copy the content of this archive onto a disk,
a disk or card image or into a dir mapped to an emulator drive.

Load v4th-c64, v4th-c16+ or v4th-x16, depending on the platform,
run it, and then type

```
include cc64-main.fth
saveall cc64
```

to compile a new cc64 binary, or likewise for cc64pe and peddi. 
Note that peddi only runs on the C64 and C16, not on the X16.
