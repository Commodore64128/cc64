Hello all,

here at last is the first (more or less) working Version of the C64
C-compiler cc64.

I'm sorry that the release comes almost half a year late. In the end
of the development I came across some really nasty disk errors which
in the end proved to come from a SpeedDos bug (the Floppy speeder I use).
Took me a lot of time to find that out ... and inbetween I had to
finish my diploma thesis (which went well after all). Anyway, when I
had the distribution disk prepared, I found one new bug, and then my
'64 broke down. So I decided to send the compiler around just the
same; to be honest I was pretty fed up with it after a few weeks of
nothing but debugging a bug that wasn't mine. The problem still there
is that the compiler seems to be unable to link static variables, but
I hope it will still give You some fun. Just use local automatic
variables and all shoud work fine. I'll fix that bug as soon as I can.

Have fun. Please send any bug reports or comments to me.
