This directory contains the original sources from which cc64v04 was
built. cc64 was written with and for ultraForth 3.8 which uses a
source format typical for classical Forth systems, namely direct
block access on disk, organizing the disk blocks into 1k chunks of
source code called screens. cc64's source spans two 1541 disks of Forth
screens:

cc64src1.d64
cc64src2.d64

Because Forth screens on a d64 image are slightly cumbersome to read on
a modern computer, I wrote a small utility that converts an untraForth
screen d64 image into a regular ascii file, with annotation comments
where each screen aka block starts:

ufscr2file.c

With this, the screen disks were converted:

cc64src1.fth
cc64src2.fth

These files aren't actually compilable Forth sources because the order
in which the screens are compiled isn't from screen 0 to screen 169.
Instead, the load screen on each disk/file which defines the order
of compiling the sources is block 2, 3 or 4, depending on the desired
compile mode/goal (development, testing or final).

One of my next goals is to split the sources into several files and to
get (or build) an ultra/volksForth version that can compile from files
rather than from screen disks.
